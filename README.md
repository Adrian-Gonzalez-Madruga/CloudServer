# CloudServer
Java Cloud Server paired with [Java Android Cloud Client](https://github.com/Adrian-Gonzalez-Madruga/CloudClient) to act as a file server. This server authenticates a user via sql, may download or upload to/from the client archiving data in their own folders and pathing using json. Pathing to the JSON uses a special character string that only allows the user who signed in to get their selected folder increasing the security of the application. The Cloud Server also connects/disconnects multiple users at a time allowing for synchronous usage of the server.


## Getting Started
The Cloud Server is ready to run with no setup after downloading repository. Running will let the program listen on the selected port for a connection from the client.
